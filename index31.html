        <p>I've just added two new links to the column on the right. Both of the links broadcast interviews/talks with people that are influential. I really like listening how people do what they do and hopefully I'll be inspired by them. The first link is to a show that I like, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Rose_(talk_show)">Charlie Rose Show</a>, you can watch interviews with famous people <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/">here</a>. Check out the interview with John Grisham at <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/clip/9507">http://www.charlierose.com/view/clip/9507</a>.<br /><br />The other link is to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_talks">TED Talks</a>, they give annual prizes to people who have made some difference to humanity, in a good way. They have many important people who gave talks and you can watch freely from <a href="http://www.ted.com/">their website</a>. Check out an interesting <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/paul_koontz_shares_his_pix_of_north_korea.html">talk about North Korea</a>, with some interesting photos.<br /><br />I am going to check these two websites from time to time to see if they put on interesting videos. Have fun!</p>

        <p>ROSE: Have you ever been in love?<br /><br />DESIRE: You might say that.<br /><br />ROSE: Horrible, isn't it?<br /><br />DESIRE: In what way?<br /><br />ROSE: It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens your heart and it means someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses. You build up this whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...<br /><br />You give them a piece of you. They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day like kiss you, or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore.<br /><br />Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like "Maybe we should just be friends" or "How very perceptive" turns into a glass splinter working its way to your heart.<br /><br />DESIRE: How picturesque.<br /><br />ROSE: It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. <br /><br />Nothing should be able to do that.<br /><br />Especially not love.<br /><br />I hate love. <br /><br /><br />[ From Neil Gaiman's "Sandman Library-The Kindly Ones", as quoted by Aykut Erdem.]</p>

            Ruby vs PHP, Rails vs Symfony

        <p>OK, I'm one of those interesting people who have started web development with Ruby on Rails and now migrating to PHP. For those who are like me, let me give some advise on this topic.<br /><br />First of all, the Framework dilemma. PHP has enormous number of frameworks written for it. This is of course much more than what is written on Ruby. And the trouble is, there's no single killer application on PHP like there is Rails for Ruby. So there are frameworks like Symfony, CakePHP, Zend Framework, CodeIgniter ... The list goes on and on. My advise is that research a little and pick one that suits you most without getting into too much detail. In the end I think all frameworks have their advantages and it'll be simpler and more fun when you don't delve into details in the beginning. This way you won't be losing too much time on this, and you can focus on your work. If later you don't like the framework I think you can migrate easily. Although I must add that so far Symfony seems to be greatly influenced by Rails way of doing things, and I really like that. So if you are looking for a framework with Rails philosophy I think Symfony is a safe bet.<br /><br />Secondly, you won't find many of the nice tools you took for granted while using Rails when you switch to PHP. One of those tools is the interactive ruby shell (irb). This is such a great tool that you can see your code results easily and effortlessly. No need to write a script and add printing statements. Default PHP installation has '-a' switch for interactivity but it is too clumsy. Just try it with 'php -a' and you'll see. Of course there's a solution. You can pick many of the PHP interactive shells written by others. I've just installed <a href="http://jan.kneschke.de/projects/php-shell/">php-shell</a> which looks promising. I added the readline module to PHP cli so that it also has command line history. This shell also does code completion. Cool or what :)<br /><br />This is my thoughts for today. As I come up with different problems (and solutions) I'll be posting them here. Bye for now.</p>
