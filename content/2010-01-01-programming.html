<blockquote><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Seibel:</span> Do you still program a lot?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Peyton Jones:</span> Oh yes. I write some code every day. It's not actually every day, but that's my mantra. I think there's this horrible danger that people who are any good at anything get promoted or become more important until they don't get to do the thing they're any good at anymore.<br /></blockquote><br />From <span style="font-style:italic;">Coders at Work, Reflections on the Craft of Programming</span> by Peter Seibel.
