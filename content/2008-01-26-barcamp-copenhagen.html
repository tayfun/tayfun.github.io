I think I was the only international there so a few of the presentations had to be done in English because of me :) Anyway, Danes are fluent in English so I guess it was not difficult for them, and the web site for BarCamp was in English so I thought the presentations would be also (I'm not to blame :)) The thing about these types of events is that thanks to the Internet you can read <a href="http://www.henrietteweber.com/">lots</a> <a href="http://dlade.net/">and</a> <a href="http://blogging.gelle.dk/">lots</a> of <a href="http://casperfabricius.com/">blogs</a> or watch webcasts but its still a lot different when you get to meet the people behind these web sites in person. You do realize that they are humans just like you and get more courage in following on things you normally wouldn't. I met a lot of cool people and learned a lot of new things and had really good time so what more can you expect? I think it would have helped me more if I knew Danish so that I can easily get in conversation with others but...<br /><br />Here are some photos I did take. I don't like using flash indoors and I couldn't hold still for 1/8 seconds so excuse me if some are blurry.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/R5qQSm-CCCI/AAAAAAAAAg0/TdadoSa8EZs/s1600-h/DSCN8992.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/R5qQSm-CCCI/AAAAAAAAAg0/TdadoSa8EZs/s400/DSCN8992.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5159594972479096866" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/R5qQS2-CCDI/AAAAAAAAAg8/O4P0SmiFdOI/s1600-h/DSCN8994.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/R5qQS2-CCDI/AAAAAAAAAg8/O4P0SmiFdOI/s400/DSCN8994.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5159594976774064178" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/R5qQTW-CCEI/AAAAAAAAAhE/BER2O32SOP4/s1600-h/DSCN8995.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/R5qQTW-CCEI/AAAAAAAAAhE/BER2O32SOP4/s400/DSCN8995.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5159594985363998786" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/R5qQTm-CCFI/AAAAAAAAAhM/8eYspd6nGec/s1600-h/DSCN8996.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/R5qQTm-CCFI/AAAAAAAAAhM/8eYspd6nGec/s400/DSCN8996.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5159594989658966098" border="0" /></a><br />I'm now looking forward to other events elsewhere!
