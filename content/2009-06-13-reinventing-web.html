title: Reinventing the Web?

I wonder what <a href="http://www.opera.com/freedom/">Opera Software will be launching on June 16th</a>. There are some clues in the web page source code and it seems to be updated periodically. The first clue in the code is inside the description meta tag:<br /><code><br />&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;The Web is your browser. Discover how fast and fun the Web can be.&quot; /&gt;<br /></code><br />And in the comments:<br /><code><br />&lt;!--  <br />We start our little story with the invention of the modern day computer. <br />Over the years, the computers grew in numbers, and the next natural step in the evolution was to connect them together. To share things.<br />But as these little networks grew, some computers gained more power than the rest and called themselves servers ...<br />--&gt;<br /></code><br />The description tag makes me think of a new Opera widget/extension/customization framework with a supporting cloud service (notice the cloud image on the page) that enables an easier and more comfortable web browsing. I certainly don't know what the features could be, so this idea is just a shot at a wide possibility in this area.<br /><br />The embedded HTML comments makes me think of P2P browsing of some sort. Can Opera be preparing to roll out a new technology that would be blurring the line between web browsers (ie. the clients) and the web servers? P2P is not the exact wording I'm looking for, I'm looking for something which doesn't have a name yet, much like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ">Google Wave</a> technology unveiled at the I/O conference.<br /><br />Whatever it is, we'll have to wait until the 16th for sure. I hope it lives up to its promise :)
