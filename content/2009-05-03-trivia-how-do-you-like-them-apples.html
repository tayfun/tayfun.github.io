<blockquote>&quot;How do you like them apples?&quot;, also shortened to, &quot;How do you like them?&quot; or, &quot;Them apples&quot;, is a phrase used to gloat or to express bemusement. In both senses, the phrase acts as a rhetorical question. The origin of this idiom is uncertain. The phrase experienced a resurgence after being said by Matt Damon in the 1997 movie Good Will Hunting.</blockquote><br /><br />from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_do_you_like_them_apples">Wikipedia</a>.
