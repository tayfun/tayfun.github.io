If on Linux you are using PulseAudio (so that you can have many goodies such as multiple channels etc.) but your flash videos played by firefox are without sound, check out the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4834073">fix given here</a>.<br /><br />Seems that there's a package that needs to be installed for this to work. Kudos to the one with the solution.
