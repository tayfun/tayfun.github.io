<blockquote>... One way is to make it so simple that there are <em>obviously no deficiencies</em> and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are <em>no obvious deficiencies</em>. The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a <em>willingness to accept objectives</em> which are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints, and to accept a <em>compromise</em> when conflicting objectives cannot be met. <em>No committee</em> will ever do this until it is too late.</blockquote><br />From Tony Hoare's Turing Award speech (emphasis mine).
