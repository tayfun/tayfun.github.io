I've encountered this error twice now, so I ought to be blogging about it to let others now. In case more people stumble into it or if I need my solution again in the future. So here it is:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Problem:</span> You've just upgraded from 2.4.something to version 3 (3.0.1 in my case) and when you launch openoffice, you get the usual dialogue:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/SZ7W9V4jwNI/AAAAAAAABPA/1yjS6HksZSo/s1600-h/Screenshot-2.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/SZ7W9V4jwNI/AAAAAAAABPA/1yjS6HksZSo/s400/Screenshot-2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304913760423755986" /></a><br />But when you click on a document type to create a new one, the application crashes and after a restart you are presented with a window to recover it:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/SZ7W9jfo6vI/AAAAAAAABPI/9SlXKYGNkw4/s1600-h/Screenshot.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/SZ7W9jfo6vI/AAAAAAAABPI/9SlXKYGNkw4/s400/Screenshot.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304913764077333234" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/SZ7W9rXncbI/AAAAAAAABPQ/e_kc7x5dcY0/s1600-h/Screenshot-1.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/SZ7W9rXncbI/AAAAAAAABPQ/e_kc7x5dcY0/s400/Screenshot-1.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304913766191165874" /></a><br /><br />And this goes on almost recursively, with no base condition (!).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The solution:</span> Simply delete your old settings. But <span style="font-weight:bold;">beware, your settings won't be recovered</span>. It's wise to make a back up of your important configuration files so that you can use them later if needed. Use this at your own risk:<br /><br /><code>$ cd<br />$ rm -rf .openoffice.org</code><br /><br />Note that you need to run the second command from your home directory, that is the reason for the first command.<br /><br />Next time you run OpenOffice, this directory will be created and default setting files populated inside. And hopefully, you'll be able to run OpenOffice without a problem.<br /><br />Cheers.
