<p>Excellent post on the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443866404577565781327694346.html?mod=WSJ__MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsThird">importance of sleep</a>. Did you know that we used to sleep in two cycles and for much more time then we now do until very recently?</p>

<p>Also from that article:</p>
<blockquote>
Now we have so much artificial light that after a 1994 earthquake knocked out power, some concerned residents of Los Angeles called the police to report a "giant, silvery cloud" in the sky above them. It was the Milky Way. They had never seen it before.

<p>I wonder what else we lose living in a "modern" society.</p>
