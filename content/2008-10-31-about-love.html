<blockquote>They say love is in the details, that it's the little things that make a person special, but then why are the love songs so alike? It's your smile, it's your eyes, I love your eyes and your smile. I like to go to the beach with you, but really the beach is so interesting and pretty that you could take anyone to the beach.</blockquote><br />From the novel Adverbs by Daniel Handler. Harper Perennial, 2006.
