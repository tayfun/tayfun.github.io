I had listened to this song before many times but I didn't think it was any special. This morning, while running it came up again in my mp3 player and it has kept with me ever since. I just can't stop muttering the melody and lyrics :)<br /><br />Here is the song and the lyrics to captivate you as well. Enjoy!<br /><br /><object><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lJbz5HaKCJc&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lJbz5HaKCJc&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">cannonball</span><br /> <br />there's still a little bit of your taste in my mouth<br />there's still a little bit of you laced with my doubt<br />it's still a little hard to say what's going on<br />there's still a little bit of your ghost your witness<br />there's still a little piece of your face i haven't kissed<br />you step a little closer to me<br />still i can't see what's going on<br />stones taught me to fly<br />love taught me to lie<br />life taught me to die<br />so it's not hard to fall<br />when you float like a cannonball<br />there's still a little bit of your song in my ear<br />there's still a little bit of your words i long to hear<br />you step a little closer each day<br />so close that i can't see what's going on<br />stones taught me to fly<br />love taught me to lie<br />life taught me to die<br />so it's not hard to fall<br />when you float like a cannon<br />stones taught me to fly<br />love taught me to cry<br />so come on courage<br />teach me to be shy<br />'cause it's not hard to fall<br />and i don't want to scare her<br />it's not hard to fall<br />and i don't wanna lose<br />it's not hard to grow<br />when you know that you just don't know
