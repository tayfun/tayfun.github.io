Turns out there are not many templates that come with OpenOffice.org Impress, which is used for creating presentations. Check out <a href="http://www.presentationhelper.co.uk/free-open-office-impress-templates-91.htm">presentation helper</a>, which has really good free presentation designs.<br /><br />To go along with that, <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/FAQ/Writer/FormattingPagesAndDocuments/How_do_I_add_my_own_templates%3F">OpenOffice.org Wiki</a> page has the instructions for enabling them on Impress.<br /><br />Click on File->Templates->Organize and then add them using Command->Import Template.
