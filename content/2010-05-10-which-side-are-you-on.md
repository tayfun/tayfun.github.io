<blockquote><br />The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalist and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of executioners.<br /></blockquote><br />From the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Zinn">Howard Zinn</a>'s <span style="font-style:italic;">A People's History of the United States</span>.<br /><br />I think being on the side of the suffering is many times underestimated. People think it doesn't matter what they do, simply because of the sheer hugeness of the dark side. I believe the opposite. What you think, what you say and do matters much more than you anticipate; and when organized, no force is big enough to stop your rightful initiative.
