Memento mori is a Latin phrase that may be freely translated as "Remember that you are mortal," "Remember you will die," or "Remember your death".<br /><br />In ancient Rome, the phrase is said to have been used on the occasions when a Roman general was parading through the streets of Rome during the victory celebration known as a triumph. Standing behind the victorious general was a slave, and he had the task of reminding the general that, though he was up on the peak today, tomorrow was another day. The servant did this by telling the general that he should remember that he was mortal, i.e. "Memento mori." (It is possible that the servant said instead "Respice post te! Hominem te esse memento!" (Look behind you! Remember that you are but a man!) as cited by Tertullian in chapter 33 of his Apologeticus.)<br /><br />...<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">Wiki'deki "Memento mori" sayfasÄ±</a><br /><br /><br />{burda "memento" hatirlamak demek sanirim.
