If they answer not to thy call walk alone,<br />If they are afraid and cower mutely facing the wall,<br />O thou of evil luck,<br />open thy mind and speak out alone.<br /><br />If they turn away, and desert you when crossing the wilderness,<br />O thou of evil luck,<br />trample the thorns under thy tread,<br />and along the blood-lined track travel alone.<br /><br />If they do not hold up the light when the night is troubled with storm,<br />O thou of evil luck,<br />with the thunder flame of pain ignite thy own heart<br />and let it burn alone.<br /><br />From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore">Tagore</a><br /><br />(eğer çağrına kulak vermezlerse, yalnız yürü!)
