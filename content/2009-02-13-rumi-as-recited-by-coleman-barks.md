I keep coming back to it everyday. Here are the words:<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><h2>Who Says Words with My Mouth</h2></span><br />All day<br />I think about it,<br />then at night<br />I say it.<br /><br />"Where did I come from,<br />and what am I supposed<br />to be doing?"<br /><br />I have no idea.<br /><br />My soul is from elsewhere,<br />I'm sure of that,<br />and I intend to end up there.<br /><br />This drunkenness<br />began in some other tavern.<br />When I get back around to that place,<br />I'll be completely sober.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'm like a bird<br />from another continent, sitting in this aviary.<br /><br />The day is coming when I fly off,<br />but who is it now in my ear, who hears my voice?<br />Who says words with my mouth?<br /><br />Who looks out with my eyes? What is the soul?<br />I cannot stop asking.<br /><br />If I could taste one sip of an answer,<br />I could break out of this prison for drunks.<br /><br />I didn't come here of my own accord, and I can't leave that way.<br />Whoever brought me here will have to take me Home.<br /><br />This poetry. I never know what I'm going to say.<br />I don't plan it.<br />When I'm outside the saying of it,<br />I get very quiet and rarely speak at all.<br /><br />Shams Tabriz, if you would show your face to me again<br />I could flee, the imposition of this life.
