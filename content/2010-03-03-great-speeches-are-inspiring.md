<blockquote>[...]<br />Rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, or our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation. The issue of equal right for the American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation...<br /></blockquote><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>'s speech on human rights issues of the blacks. From the book "Obama's Challenge" by Robert Kuttner. <br /><br />It's a great speech winning the hearts and minds of ordinary people. As a foreigner, it is quite dazzling to me that the blacks could not vote until well into the 1960s, that they were deprived of many basic human rights that we take as granted today.<br /><br />I'm also excited to see that Turkey has a long path to go and I hope my generation will lead her, when the time comes.
