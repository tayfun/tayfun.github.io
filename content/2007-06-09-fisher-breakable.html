Eski bir şarkı. Charles Dickens'in aynı adlı kitabından uyarlanan Büyük Umutlar film müziği içinde. Kitap da film de harikaydı bence. Fazla uzatmadan sözleri de ekleyip size şarkıyı dinlemeyi bırakıyorum. <br /><center><br /><embed id="radioblog_player_0" src="http://stat.radioblogclub.com/radio.blog/skins/mini/player.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" bgcolor="#ECECEC" flashvars="id=0&filepath=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ceng.metu.edu.tr%2F~e1347939/musiki/Fisher%20-%20Breakable.rbs&amp;colors=body:#ECECEC;border:#BBBBBB;button:#999999;player_text:#999999;playlist_text:#999999;"></embed><br /></center><br /><br /><center><span style="font-weight:bold;">Fisher - Breakable</span><br /><br />Do you always have to tell him everything<br />On your mind?<br />You know that too much honesty can be<br />So unkind<br />And every time you throw him to the floor<br />Why are you surprised to see he's breakable?<br />You always try to find what's holding him<br />Away from you<br />But do you ever see your anger standing there<br />Right between you?<br />And every time you throw him to the wall<br />Why are you surprised to see he's breakable?<br />Tell the world that he's breaking your heart<br />Go tell the world nothing's ever your fault<br />Go tell them all<br />And every time you throw him to the floor<br />Why are you surprised to see he's breakable?<br />And every time you push him to the wall<br />Why are you surprised to see he's breakable?<br /></center>
