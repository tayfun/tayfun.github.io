title: YouTube Lights Out Feature - through Greasemonkey
time: 2009-05-24 08:43:00 +03:00
About a month ago I was frustrated with YouTube because one of the videos I was viewing at the time had a "turn off the lights" and "expand the view" feature but other videos did not. Apparently a few selected videos have this feature, mostly long length movies and videos uploaded by premium users/corporations. I wanted to copy these features to other videos so I added this task to my to-do list. A few days ago I sat with this intention and was able to code it easily. I'm releasing this as a Greasemonkey script. To show you what it is capable of, see this screenshot:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/Sh1lee2aZAI/AAAAAAAABRY/TVEDfQiiiTE/s1600-h/opera-lightsoff3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/Sh1lee2aZAI/AAAAAAAABRY/TVEDfQiiiTE/s400/opera-lightsoff3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5340536307483042818" /></a><br />This screenshot shows how lights out feature works. The screenshot has been taken using the Opera browser but the script also works for Mozilla Firefox.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/ShjfexVnEdI/AAAAAAAABRI/JLM3aZRw2b0/s1600-h/large.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 296px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AZvuJ9kmERM/ShjfexVnEdI/AAAAAAAABRI/JLM3aZRw2b0/s400/large.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5339263077980770770" /></a><br />The two buttons on the right of the video title, circled with red, are the two buttons for turning the lights off and expanding the view. <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/49726">To install my script</a> on Firefox, you need to install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey add-on</a>. To install it on Opera, you simply need to download it to a folder designated as a "user scripts" folder and tell Opera about it by using the toolbar menu: Preferences->Advanced->JavaScript Options.<br /><br />You can download the script from <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/49726">UserScripts web site</a>. I hope you like it.
