I recently looked for a way for aptitude to print only the installed packages from my search terms. I looked into the man pages with no luck. Then it occurred to me it would be very easy to pipe the result to grep utility.<br /><br />So, while:<br /><code><br /># aptitude search openoffice<br />p   openoffice.org-base-core        - OpenOffice.org office suite -- libdba     <br />v   openoffice.org-bundled          -                                           <br />c   openoffice.org-calc             - OpenOffice.org office suite - spreadsheet <br />i A openoffice.org-common           - OpenOffice.org office suite architecture<br /></code><br />returns too much results (which I trimmed to show here),<br /><code><br /># aptitude search openoffice | grep ^i<br />i A openoffice.org-common           - OpenOffice.org office suite architecture i<br />i A openoffice.org-style-andromeda  - Default symbol style for OpenOffice.org   <br />i A openoffice.org-style-crystal    - Crystal symbol style for OpenOffice.org   <br />i   openoffice.org-style-hicontrast - Hicontrast symbol style for OpenOffice.org<br />i   openoffice.org-style-industrial - Industrial symbol style for OpenOffice.org<br /></code><br />only returns installed packages. <br /><br />The trick is the input to grep utility, the ^i. It instructs grep to hold only those lines which start with the letter "i". Neat isn't it?
