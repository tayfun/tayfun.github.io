<blockquote>Newspeak is a fictional language in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. In the novel, it is described as being "the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year". <br />[...] The basic idea behind Newspeak is to remove all shades of meaning from language, leaving simple dichotomies (pleasure and pain, happiness and sadness, goodthink and crimethink) which reinforce the total dominance of the State. [...] The underlying theory of Newspeak is that if something can't be said, then it can't be thought. <br /></blockquote><br />from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak">Wikipedia</a>.
