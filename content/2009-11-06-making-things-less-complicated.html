In <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20091101/the-way-i-work-jason-fried-of-37signals.html">The Way I Work</a>, Jason Fried of the 37Signals fame talks about how he works. This paragraph about complexity caught my eye:<br /><blockquote><br />I spend another good portion of my day thinking about how to make things less complicated. In the software world, the first, second, and third versions of any product are really pretty good, because everyone can use them. Then companies start adding more and more stuff to keep their existing customers happy. But you end up dying with your customer base, because the software is too complicated for a newcomer. We keep our products simple. I'd rather have people grow out of our products, as long as more people are growing into them.<br /></blockquote>
