<blockquote>... A series of crises occurred during the years 1905-1914, and although in each case war was averted, increasing bitterness followed each diplomatic defeat, and increasing arrogance, each diplomatic victory. The losers resolved not again to be outwitted; the winners, to press their advantages while the opportunity lasted.</blockquote><br /><br />From <span style="font-style: italic;">History of Europe since 1815, Henry Littlefield. Barnes &amp; Noble, 1971.</span>
