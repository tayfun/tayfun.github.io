I've just came across a <a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=CHqcAAAAEBAJ&dq=interestingness">patent applicatio</a>n filed by Flickr co-founders <a href="http://www.caterina.net/">Caterina Fake</a> and Stewart Butterfield, among others. It describes the logic behind the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/">interestingness feature of Flickr</a>, which is one of my favorite services rendered by the photo sharing web site.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with the patent application procedure, I wonder what the outcome has been. It was filed about 3 years ago after all. It does talk about some common knowledge, by common knowledge I mean knowledge that researchers in data mining, collaborative filtering areas know about. Does that make it objectionable? <br /><br />Overall, it is an interesting read to learn more about the behind the scene workings of my favorite photography web page.
