time: 2009-03-18 02:16:00 +02:00
I've just found <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/software/bibutils/">this great web site</a> which has several programs for converting from one bibliography format to another. Now I can easily and effortlessly cite that <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7232/full/nature07634.html">Nature magazine article</a> in my thesis :) ris2xml and then xml2bib does the trick. Great!
